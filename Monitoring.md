This document outlines our standardized approach to monitoring Kubernetes applications using industry-standard open source tools. The system provides:

    Infrastructure health monitoring
    Application performance metrics
    Centralized logging
    Database monitoring
    Visualization dashboards

Core Components

1. Metrics Collection (Prometheus)

Purpose: Captures and stores time-series metrics from all infrastructure and applications

Key Features:

    Automatic discovery of Kubernetes resources
    Scalable time-series database
    Alerting capabilities
    Long-term storage integration

2. Log Aggregation (Loki)

Purpose: Centralizes and indexes application logs

Key Features:

    Lightweight log collection
    Efficient storage using labels
    Tight Grafana integration
    Log search and analysis

3. Visualization (Grafana)

Purpose: Provides unified dashboards for metrics and logs

Key Features:

    Customizable dashboards
    Multi-data source support
    Team collaboration features
    Alert visualization

4. Database Monitoring (PostgreSQL Exporter)

Purpose: Specialized monitoring for PostgreSQL databases

Key Features:

    Key database metrics
    Query performance insights
    Connection monitoring
    Replication status

Implementation Approach
Infrastructure Requirements

    Dedicated Kubernetes namespace for monitoring tools
    Persistent storage for time-series data
    Resource allocations based on cluster size
    Network access between components

Deployment Strategy

    Foundation Layer: Prometheus and Loki stack deployed via Helm
    Specialized Exporters: Database and application-specific metrics collectors
    Visualization Layer: Grafana with preconfigured dashboards
    Customization: Application-specific dashboard configuration

Standard Dashboards

1. Cluster Overview

   Node resource utilization
   Pod distribution
   Cluster health status
   System error rates

2. Application Performance

   Request rates and latency
   Error percentages
   Throughput metrics
   Custom business metrics

3. Database Health

   Connection pool usage
   Query performance
